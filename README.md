- 👋 Hi, I’m @SipuhaG || Sipuha || Greg
- 👀 I’m interested in GameDev && OS && modding(a bit xD)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ as main in university && also JS(Just Started) && Python(know && haven't used for long) as optional
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... IDK xD. Maybe later will choose.
- 📫 How to reach me: don't try to stalk me. I don't use social media a lot and don't have access to most of them. If you want to talk, you can offer forum or ask for
my Discord. I wish their is chat to do it XD
